            <p> <br> <br> <br> Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code 
                editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. 
                Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, 
                intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>

                    The JavaScript console is a command line interface in your browser that can execute snippets of code.
                    When that code snippet is designed to interact with the webpage you are currently on,
                    result can happen that might not have been possible otherwise. You can access the console by right-clicking, then clicking 
                    'Inspect'.</p>
